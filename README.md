The Puzzle of Economic Development

This study investigates the relationship between Human Development Index (HDI) indicators
and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, exploring the impact of geography on
development. Using the 2021 UNDP HDI dataset, visual inspection suggests an exponential
link between GNI per capita and Life Expectancy. Multiple linear regression confirms significant
correlations with Life Expectancy and Mean Years of Schooling. Principal Component Analysis
reveals geographical influences. Evidence supports the hypothesis that a nation's economic
development is influenced by its geography, with Asia and Africa generally ranking lower than
Europe, America, or Australia. This study contributes insights into multidimensional aspects of
economic development within a limited geographical scope.
